    "A company store held an event for customers - a master class using the products of the outlet. After the successful completion of the master class, the director instructs the administrator to wash and box the goods used for the event and transfer them to the warehouse according to the delivery note.\n",
    "The administrator, already busy with work in a hurry, entrusts this task to a sales consultant (not a direct subordinate), who packs the goods in wet and not dried, and sends them to the warehouse. The warehouse employees write a memo to the director that the packaging is spoiled and the goods worth 150 thousand rubles are damaged. The director wants to recover this value from the administrator and the salesperson. The administrator does not see his guilt, as there are usually at least two administrators from the company working on such events, but he had to do everything alone and believes that the consultant set him up. The consultant, on the other hand, believes that this is not his area of responsibility and therefore is not ready to be held responsible for the fact that he agreed to help in a job that is not his own.\n",
