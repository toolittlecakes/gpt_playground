**Administrator**
I understand there's been an issue with the goods from the master class. I want to explain the situation from my perspective.

**Director**
I'm listening, but let's be clear: the bottom line is that we have a significant loss that needs to be addressed. Go ahead with your explanation.

**Administrator**
Absolutely, I recognize the seriousness of the loss. On the day of the event, I was the only administrator present, which is not the norm. We were understaffed, and I had to manage multiple roles simultaneously, which stretched me thin.

**Director**
Being understaffed is unfortunate, but it doesnâ€™t change the fact that the goods were your responsibility. Why did you delegate the task to the sales consultant without proper oversight?

**Administrator**
I delegated the task because I was handling several urgent matters at once. The sales consultant seemed competent, and I gave him clear instructions. It was a judgment call made under pressure to ensure all tasks were completed.

**Director**
I understand the pressure, but a judgment call that results in a loss of 150 thousand rubles is concerning. Competence in sales doesn't necessarily translate to competence in handling goods. It was still your responsibility to ensure the task was done correctly.

**Administrator**
I accept that it was my responsibility. However, I want to stress that this was an extraordinary situation. The consultant had handled similar tasks before without issue. Given the circumstances, I made the best decision I could at the moment.

**Director**
I see your point, but good judgment is critical, especially in extraordinary situations. We need to ensure this doesn't happen again. How do you propose we resolve the financial loss and prevent future incidents?

**Administrator**
To address the financial loss, I propose a shared responsibility approach. Considering the unique circumstances, holding only me or the sales consultant accountable seems unfair. Perhaps a portion of the loss could be absorbed by the company, and the rest split between us?

For prevention, I suggest implementing a clear protocol for such events, including a backup plan for staffing shortages. This way, everyone knows their roles and responsibilities, even under pressure.

**Director**
Absorbing part of the loss is a significant concession for the company. However, I'm willing to consider a shared responsibility approach if it includes a clear commitment to improving our processes. As for the split, what percentage are you suggesting for the company, yourself, and the sales consultant? And I agree, we need a robust protocol in place. Let's discuss specifics.

**Administrator**
I appreciate the company's willingness to consider shared responsibility. Given the circumstances, I suggest the company absorbs 50% of the loss due to the staffing issue being a managerial oversight. The remaining 50% could be split between myself and the sales consultant, with 25% each. Does this seem fair to you?

Regarding the protocol, I believe creating a detailed checklist for event procedures and a mandatory double-check system when transferring goods would be effective.

**Director**
A 50% absorption by the company is a sizable amount, but I'm inclined to agree if it leads to a learning opportunity and future prevention. Your proposal of splitting the remaining 50% equally between you and the sales consultant seems reasonable under the circumstances.

Your protocol suggestions are a good start. I want a drafted plan on my desk by the end of the week for review. Can I count on you for that?

**Administrator**
Yes, you can count on me. I will draft a detailed event protocol plan and have it on your desk by the end of the week for your review and feedback. Thank you for understanding and working towards a fair resolution.
