**Administrator**
I understand there's an issue with the goods from the master class, but I need to explain my side.

**Director**
I'm listening, but make it quick. I want to understand why you think you're not responsible for the damaged goods.

**Administrator**
I was managing the event alone, which is typically a two-admin job. Overwhelmed, I asked the sales consultant for help. It's not standard to have them pack goods, but I was in a bind.

**Director**
A two-admin job, you say. But you still made the decision to delegate to someone outside their role. You're responsible for overseeing the process, aren't you?

**Administrator**
Yes, I am, but the situation was exceptional. The consultant volunteered, and I assumed they understood the importance of properly handling the products. My mistake was not double-checking their work.

**Director**
An exceptional situation doesn't absolve you of following procedures. You assumed instead of verifying - that's where things went wrong. What do you suggest we do now?

**Administrator**
I propose we discuss a fair solution. Perhaps we can implement a training for all staff on handling goods post-events. As for the costs, I'm open to discussion but don't feel it's just to bear the full burden.

**Director**
Training is a good start, but it doesn't address the immediate financial loss. As for the costs, we'll need to evaluate the extent of your responsibility. Remember, accountability is key here. Let's talk numbers and responsibility sharing.

**Administrator**
I understand the importance of accountability. Could we consider a shared responsibility approach, given the unique circumstances and the fact that it was a team effort, albeit an improvised one?

**Director**
Shared responsibility might be reasonable, but we need clear terms. How do you propose we split the costs, and what measures will you personally take to prevent a recurrence?

**Administrator**
I suggest a split based on involvement. I'll accept a larger share since I was in charge, but I believe the consultant should also contribute. To prevent this, I'll create a checklist for event procedures and ensure proper training for all staff.

**Director**
A checklist and training are proactive steps. As for the split, I need specifics. What percentage are you suggesting for yourself and the consultant? And remember, this needs to address the immediate financial loss effectively.

**Administrator**
Considering my role and responsibility, I propose I cover 60% of the costs. The consultant, being less culpable, could take on 40%. This reflects the situation's complexity and our respective involvements.

**Director**
60-40 is a significant ask. I'll consider it, but only if the consultant agrees. And I want your commitment to the new procedures in writing. If this happens again, the consequences will be more severe. Are we clear?

**Administrator**
Absolutely clear. I'm committed to making the necessary improvements and will put this in writing. I'll also speak with the consultant to ensure we're on the same page. Thank you for understanding the situation and working towards a fair solution.

**Director**
Good. Have that discussion with the consultant and bring me the agreement in writing. I expect full implementation of the new procedures and no repeat of this incident. Now, let's get back to work and fix this mess.
