# Conflicts

## Conflict Definition

*Conflict* is a process of changing the social roles and statuses of the persons involved. It could be conscious or unconscious.

There are two roles in conflict: Attack and Defender. The Attack is the person who starts the conflict. The goal of the Attack is to impose a new social role on the Defender (e.g. egoist, liar, unprofessional, lazy, untrustworthy, etc.). The Defender's goal is to keep their social role unchanged.

Conflict could be emotional or rational. Emotional conflict is a conflict that is caused by emotions and feelings. Rational conflict is a conflict that is caused by the conscious decision of the Attack.

## Manipulation

Conflict can involve the manipulation of the Defender.

*Manipulation* is the covert influence on emotions in order to gain rational gain or increase one's authority.

There are 2 axes of manipulation:

1. Effect type: Aggressor, Victim
2. Reason type: Accuser, Fellow

### Effect type

* Aggressor. Presses feelings of fear.
* Victim. Tries to induce feelings of pity or shame.

### Reason type

* The accuser. Guilt-ridden.
* fellow. The opposite of the accuser, tries to bring the interlocutor closer to himself and press on feelings of duty, love. Forces to be trouble-free.

### Combinations

Manipulation **always has two parts** and forms 4 possible strategies:

#### Aggressor - accuser (You should be scared because you are guilty)

##### Example 1

A friend borrowed money from an entrepreneur. Two months have passed since he promised to pay it back and has not done so. At a meeting of school friends, the entrepreneur asked when the debt would be repaid, to which he heard...

üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Has money become more important to you in business than friendship?

* Aggressor: You should be **afraid** of loosing your friends.
* Accuser: You are **guilty** of putting money over friendship (It's your **fault** for having your priorities wrong)

##### Example 2

The father spent another weekend with his friends fishing, leaving his children at home. His wife said to him...

üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I see you're not as interested in spending time with your kids as you are with your friends. Let's see if your kids will spend time with you when you're old.

* Aggressor: You should be **scared** of loosing your kids' attention.

#### Victim - accuser (You should be ashamed because you are at fault)

##### Example 1

#### Aggressor - Fellow (You should be scared because you love/need/are grateful)

##### Example 1

##### Example 2

The father spent another weekend with his friends fishing, leaving his children at home. His wife said to him...

* Of course, you can go on vacation for 2 months... But you realize that if KPIs are not met, your whole team will be left without bonuses, right?
  * Aggressor: you should be **afraid** of letting your team down.
  * Fellow: you have a **duty** to the team, they are **counting** on you.*

#### Victim - Fellow (You should feel sorry because you should/are grateful/love)

##### Example 1
