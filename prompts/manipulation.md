## Manipulation

Conflict may involve manipulation of the Aggressor versus the Defender

*Manipulation* is the covert influence on emotions in order to gain rational gain or increase one's authority.

There are 2 axes of manipulation:

* **Emotional Manipulation Axis** (the Y axis)
  * This axis focuses on the emotional state that the Aggressor tries to evoke in the Defender. It can range from inducing fear to eliciting sympathy or shame.
* **Relational Dynamics Axis** (the X axis)
  * This axis addresses how the Aggressor positions themselves in relation to the Defender, either by creating distance and guilt (as an accuser) or by fostering closeness and a sense of obligation (as a Connector).

#### Emotional Manipulation Axis

* **Scary (Fear Induction)**: Tactics aimed at making the Defender feel threatened or anxious. (showing the negative consequences for Aggressor of not doing what the Aggressor wants)
* **Sympathetic (Shame Induction)**: Strategies designed to make the Defender feel pity, guilt, or shame, often by the Aggressor presenting themselves as a victim or by shaming the target for not complying. (showing how the Defender's actions hurt the Aggressor - negative consequences for the Aggressor himself)

#### Relational Dynamics Axis

* **Accuser (Against)**: The Aggressor adopts a position of blaming or criticizing, making the Defender feel guilty or at fault. (we are on opposite sides, I am blaming you)
* **Connector (Together)**: The Aggressor seeks to create a sense of connection or indebtedness, leveraging feelings of loyalty, duty, or love to influence the Defender. (we are on the same side, I am helping you)

### Combinations

By intersecting these axes, you form a matrix that defines four primary manipulation strategies. Each quadrant represents a different combination of emotional manipulation and relational dynamics:

1. **Scary-Accuser**: Utilizes fear and guilt, positioning as a threatening accuser.
2. **Scary-Connector**: Leverages fear but aims to bond over shared vulnerabilities or challenges.
3. **Sympathetic-Accuser**: Induces guilt or shame, often by playing the Defender in a way that accuses the target of insensitivity or neglect.
4. **Sympathetic-Connector**: Evokes feelings of pity or shame while fostering a sense of closeness or obligation.

**Note**: You don't have to always use manipulation to win a conflict. It's just one of the options.
