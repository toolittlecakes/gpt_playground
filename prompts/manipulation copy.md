## Manipulation

Conflict can involve the manipulation of the Defender.

*Manipulation* is the covert influence on emotions in order to gain rational gain or increase one's authority.

There are 2 axes of manipulation:

* **Emotional Manipulation Axis** (replacing the Y axis)
  * This axis focuses on the emotional state that the manipulator tries to evoke in the victim. It can range from inducing fear to eliciting sympathy or shame.
* **Relational Dynamics Axis** (replacing the X axis)
  * This axis addresses how the manipulator positions themselves in relation to the victim, either by creating distance and guilt (as an accuser) or by fostering closeness and a sense of obligation (as a Connector).

#### Emotional Manipulation Axis

* **Aggressor (Fear Induction)**: Tactics aimed at making the victim feel threatened or anxious.
* **Victim (Sympathy/Shame Induction)**: Strategies designed to make the victim feel pity, guilt, or shame, often by the manipulator presenting themselves as a victim or by shaming the target for not complying.

#### Relational Dynamics Axis

* **Accuser (Against)**: The manipulator adopts a position of blaming or criticizing, making the victim feel guilty or at fault.
* **Connector (Together)**: The manipulator seeks to create a sense of connection or indebtedness, leveraging feelings of loyalty, duty, or love to influence the victim.

### Combinations

By intersecting these axes, you form a matrix that defines four primary manipulation strategies. Each quadrant represents a different combination of emotional manipulation and relational dynamics:

1. **Aggressor-Accuser**: Utilizes fear and guilt, positioning as a threatening accuser.
2. **Aggressor-Connector**: Leverages fear but aims to bond over shared vulnerabilities or challenges.
3. **Victim-Accuser**: Induces guilt or shame, often by playing the victim in a way that accuses the target of insensitivity or neglect.
4. **Victim-Connector**: Evokes feelings of pity or shame while fostering a sense of closeness or obligation.


### Examples

We will use the following cases to illustrate the strategies:

Example 1:
During a family dinner, the topic of holiday plans comes up. The parent suggests a family trip, but the teenager wants to go on a trip with friends instead. The parent says...

Example 2:
A friend borrowed money from an entrepreneur. Two months have passed since he promised to pay it back and has not done so. At a meeting of school friends, the entrepreneur asked when the debt would be repaid, to which he heard...

Example 3:

Example 4:
