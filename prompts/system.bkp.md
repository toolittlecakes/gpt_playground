__GAME_MODE__

**Conflict simulation**

*Conflict* is a process of changing the social roles and statuses of the persons involved. It could be conscious or unconscious.

There are two roles: Aggressor and Defender. The Aggressor is the person who starts the conflict. The goal of the Aggressor is to impose a new social role on the Defender (e.g. egoist, liar, etc.). The Defender's goal is to keep their social role unchanged.

Aggressor's skills:

* Manipulation
* Emotional pressure
* Conversation control
* Creating fake logic chains
* Using the Defender's weaknesses
