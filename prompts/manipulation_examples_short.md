### Examples

* **Scary-Accuser**
  * Employees who want a promotion check their email every hour, including weekends!
  * The main thing is that words do not diverge from deeds!
  * Then let's not waste my time anymore...
* **Scary-Connector**
  * With resources, anyone can do it. But can you save the company’s budget and complete the task with what you have?
  * You realize that not all companies will trust and respect you as we do, right? I give you the most difficult and interesting projects, because I've known since college how responsible you are. Such trust is hard to earn, but it's easy to lose it.
* **Sympathetic-Accuser**
  * Yes, I conducted the negotiations myself. And they were successful! Unlike you, I don’t say too much to my clients.
* **Sympathetic-Connector** (I was counting on you, but you let me down)
  * To be honest, I didn’t expect such a question from you. You need to be able to adapt to circumstances!
  * I'm sorry that, considering how much I've done for your growth, you don't root for the team...
  * And I hoped that I could rely on your professional word.
  * Maybe I really put too much on you...
  * Mom and I always finish your duties, but football is more important to you than helping your parents?
  * All this time I have been trying to make sure that your career goes uphill...
  * Sorry, I just wanted to show how much your team and company need you!
