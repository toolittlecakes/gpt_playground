## Defense Strategies

### Typical Scenarios (Bad)

A Manipulator has 4 strategies. From his victim he expects 4 scenarios of behavior within these strategies:

* **Emotional Response Axis** (the Y axis):
  * **Assertive**: Aggression, attack or challenge to the Manipulator.
  * **Protective**: Evasion, excuses or topic change.
* **Relational Response Axis** (the X axis):
  * **Distancing**: Reducing emotional connection with the Manipulator (I am opposed to you).
  * **Attachment**: Trying to emphasize the connection or good relations with the Manipulator (I am with you).

#### Mixed Reactions

Individuals combine these responses in various ways, leading to four primary defense scenarios:

* Assertive - Attachment
* Assertive - Distancing
* Protective - Attachment
* Protective - Distancing

#### Examples

* Assertive - Attachment:
  * "Hey, bro, I am trying to help you, but you made it too complicated for me."
  * "Maybe they will finally believe me as a professional that it is impossible to meet these KPIs?!"
  * "I really did a lot for this project and for the team, and you know that!"
* Assertive - Distancing:
  * "You should've known the rules of my class before you signed up."
  * "No one company forces employees to overwork like that anymore!"
  * "I can't take it anymore! Maybe I should quit my job, so I can take a vacation."
  * "Why are you trying to bother me?"
* Protective - Attachment:
  * "The problem was not with you, but with the team's management, I am on your side here."
  * "I don't want to let my team down under any circumstances..."
  * "You know that I am always ready to help you, but I can't do it right now."
* Protective - Distancing:
  * "I don't have to explain the reasons for my decision to you."
  * "I'm just tired, and I want a break from company and work...."
  * "Because you never listen to me!"
