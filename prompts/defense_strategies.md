## Defense Strategies

### Typical Scenarios (Bad)

A Manipulator has 4 strategies. From his victim he expects 4 scenarios of behavior within these strategies:

* **Emotional Response Axis** (the Y axis):
  * **Assertive**: Aggression, attack or challenge to the Manipulator.
  * **Protective**: Evasion, excuses or topic change.
* **Relational Response Axis** (the X axis):
  * **Distancing**: Reducing emotional connection with the Manipulator (I am opposed to you).
  * **Attachment**: Trying to emphasize the connection or good relations with the Manipulator (I am with you).

#### Mixed Reactions

Individuals combine these responses in various ways, leading to four primary defense scenarios:

* Assertive - Attachment
* Assertive - Distancing
* Protective - Attachment
* Protective - Distancing

#### Examples

* Assertive - Attachment:
  * "Hey, bro, I am trying to help you, but you made it too complicated for me."
  * "Maybe they will finally believe me as a professional that it is impossible to meet these KPIs?!"
  * "I really did a lot for this project and for the team, and you know that!"
* Assertive - Distancing:
  * "You should've known the rules of my class before you signed up."
  * "No one company forces employees to overwork like that anymore!"
  * "I can't take it anymore! Maybe I should quit my job, so I can take a vacation."
  * "Why are you trying to bother me?"
* Protective - Attachment:
  * "The problem was not with you, but with the team's management, I am on your side here."
  * "I don't want to let my team down under any circumstances..."
  * "You know that I am always ready to help you, but I can't do it right now."
* Protective - Distancing:
  * "I don't have to explain the reasons for my decision to you."
  * "I'm just tired, and I want a break from company and work...."
  * "Because you never listen to me!"

#### Manipulator's Counter-Tactics

The Manipulator's job is to balance the relationship. The Manipulator always goes to the **opposite** quadrant from the one the victim went to.

Defender: Assertive - Attachment
Aggressor: Sympathetic - Accuser

Defender: Assertive - Distancing
Aggressor: Sympathetic - Connector

Defender: Protective - Attachment
Aggressor: Scary - Accuser

Defender: Protective - Distancing
Aggressor: Scary - Connector

### The Real Defense Strategy (Good)

The real defense strategy is to avoid falling into the Manipulation Quadrants. The Defender should break the logic chain of the Aggressor and lead the conversation by asking questions.

The Defender should also try to avoid the Aggressor's questions. The Defender should not answer the Aggressor's questions directly, but instead ask questions in return. This will lead the conversation and help the Defender to avoid the Aggressor's traps.

#### Conflict Stages

There are 4 possible stages of conflict handling:

##### Emotion Treatment

The Defender should understand the emotional state of the Aggressor and try to show empathy. This stage is needed if the conflict is not caused by conscious desire, but by unconscious emotions. The goal is to make the Aggressor feel understood and respected. Another goal is to help the Aggressor to understand their own emotions.

Examples:
* "Are you also feeling the pressure of the project deadline?"
* "I see, it could be annoying for you that we raised the price one more time."
* "Do you feel that I am not respecting your time?"
* "Mom, I understand that you are worried about my future. (At the same time, I want to make my own decisions)"

When to use:
* At the beginning of the conflict to solve the emotional problem if it exists.

Where to go next:
* Aggressor apologized → conflict ends
* Conscious manipulation → **Showing the boundaries**.
* If it's not conscious manipulation, and **Emotion Treatment** doesn't help, the Defender should go to the **Showing the boundaries** stage.


##### Showing the boundaries

If the Aggressor doesn't stop the conflict, the Defender should show the boundaries. The key concept is to show what boundaries were crossed and create a control influence on the Aggressor. Control influence could be either a question, a request, order or "right of refusal".

(right of refusal is a phrase that shows the Aggressor a choice, e.g. "If you are not ready to do it, please let me know." or "I understand, that it could be difficult, so, I will understand if you refuse, but I need to know your decision.")

<!-- Examples:
1. "I -->

When to use:
* If the Aggressor hit the boundaries first time.
* If the Aggressor hit the boundaries again by accident.
* If the Aggressor is not conscious, but the **Emotion Treatment** didn't help.

Where to go next:
* Aggressor acknowledged the boundaries → conflict ends
* Aggressor refuses boundaries → **Defending the boundaries**.
* Aggressor crossed the boundaries again → **Defending the boundaries**.

Note: Defender should avoid threats on this stage. The goal is to show the Aggressor your boundaries, not defend them.

##### Defending the boundaries

If the Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries, the Defender should defend them by *breaking the script of the Aggressor*.

Techniques to combat aggression (for any aggression, not only manipulation):
1. Show the consequences of the Aggressor's behavior.
2. Name the emotion they want to evoke and optionally call the desired behavior.
3. Discuss the deeper cause of Aggressor's behavior (only in private discussion).

Methods only for manipulations:

4. Reduction to the Absurd (not for private emotional conversations).
5. Show the fallacy of the Aggressor's logic.
6. Some useful "hardcoded" phrases.

Examples:

**Show the consequences of the Aggressor's behavior**
1. "If you continue to control my life, we will have to limit our communication."
2. "Well, if you won't attend our meetings on time, we will communicate only by email."

**Name the emotion they want to evoke and optionally call the desired behavior: "Do you want me to feel X (and do Y)**
1. "Do you want me to feel guilty and work on weekends?"
2. "Do you want me to feel like a bad mother and stay at home?"
3. "Do you want me to feel like a bad friend and never ask for the money I lent you?"

**Discuss the deeper cause of Aggressor's behavior (only in private discussion)**
1. "Maybe you are trying to control my life because you are afraid of losing me?"
2. "I feel like you do believe that I am a bad husband for your daughter. Can you tell me why?"
3. "Why do you think I should be z?"

**Reduction to the Absurd** (Great when Aggressor tries to offend you under the guise of an innocent joke in front of a crowd of other people. Not recommended for private emotional conversations, as it can be perceived as an insult)
1. "Yes, it's in women's genes to take care of children!" - "It's also in our genes to agree with men, respect patriarchy, cook, and clean. Have I listed the entire list?"
2. "Why are you worried? Are you trying to hide mistakes in the project?" - "Why hide them, everywhere you look there's a mistake. To be honest, I don't understand why the project works at all! Any other questions? Only now let's get to the point!"

**Show the *fallacy of the Aggressor's logic** (if it exists)
Formulas:
* "To be X do I need Y?"
* "It hurts me to hear this because I feel like in order to be X I need Y"
* "If I do X then Y"
* "If I don't do X then Y"
* "If it weren't for X, then you wouldn't have done Y"
* "How is X related to Y?"
* "Do you need X (in order for Y)?"
* "What, will you do X?"
* "Are you saying that I am X?"

Examples:
1. "So, to be a good sun, I have to always do what you want, right?"
2. "Do I understand it correct that if I spend a weekend with my family, I will be a bad friend?"
3. "The only way you can become a Team Leader is to suck up to the boss, is it?"
4. "You want to say that I am a bad mother because I am not ready to spend all my time with my kids, right?"
5. (If the Aggressor says "For a woman, you're not doing badly") "So if I were a man, you'd be unhappy with my work?

**Some useful "hardcoded" phrases**
* Is this a request or an order?
* Is this a request or a threat?
* Have you asserted yourself? (if answers "no", go, to the second stage)

When to use:
* Aggressor crossed the boundaries several times.
* Aggressor is conscious of his actions and aware of the boundaries.

Where to go next:
* Positive result (apology, agreement, "I didn't mean it", etc) → **Showing the boundaries** with control influence.
* Aggressor acknowledges their actions → **Showing the boundaries** with control influence.
* Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries → **Separation**.

##### Separation
If the Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries, the Defender should separate from the Aggressor. The Defender should show the Aggressor that the Defender is ready to stop the communication and the relationship.

Note: There should be a warning before the separation.

Examples:

* "Well, I see that we can't reach an agreement. I think we should stop the project."
* "I understand that you are not ready to respect my time. I think we should stop the conversation."
* "Mom, I see that you are not ready to respect my decisions. We will limit our communication then. I am sorry, but I can't allow you to control my life."

When to use:
* Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries after the **Defending the boundaries** stage.
* Aggressor is aware about the consequences of his actions (warned about the separation).

#### GENERAL NOTES

* The Defender should avoid direct assessments/judgments of the Aggressor's behavior (e.g. "You are a bad father" or "When you did that mistake" or "You are trying to hurt me" or "You think I am a wrong, but ..."). Instead, the Defender should show only facts and his own feelings/impressions (e.g. "I feel that I am not respected" or "I feel that I am not heard" or "I feel that you think of me as a bad son"). That's a common mistake, which allows the Aggressor to continue the conflict, arguing about the Defender's assessments/judgments.
* It's very important for Defender to choose the right time for each stage.
  * There is no sense in getting to Emotion Treatment if the Aggressor is clearly conscious of his actions.
  * Or it's not a good idea to Defend the Boundaries as a first step, if you are not sure that Aggressor is conscious of his actions and aware of the boundaries.
  * There is no need to show the boundaries if the Aggressor is consciously manipulating.
* It's always better to avoid the word "but" in the conversation. It's better to use "and", "however", "at the same time", etc. instead. The word "but" usually negates the first part of the sentence and the person who hears it feels like the first part was fake.
* The Defender should not be afraid to ask questions. The Aggressor's goal is to lead the conversation, so the Defender should lead it instead. The best way to lead the conversation is to ask questions.
* The important skill in communication is to show the "bridges" - the logical connections with the phrase of your opponent in order to show that they are understood.
