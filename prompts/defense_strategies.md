### Defense Strategies

An Aggressor has 4 strategies. From his victim he expects 4 scenarios of behavior within these strategies:

* **Emotional Response Axis**:
  * **Assertive**: Responding with intimidation, firmness or aggression to challenge the Aggressor.
  * **Protective**: Utilizing evasion, excuses, or avoidance to protect oneself.
* **Relational Response Axis**:
  * **Distancing**: Reducing emotional connection with the Aggressor (it's not about avoiding the conversation, but about forming phrases that don't show emotional connection).
  * **Attachment**: Trying to emphasize or enhance the connection.

#### Mixed Reactions

Individuals may combine these responses in various ways, leading to four primary defense scenarios:

* Assertive - Attachment
* Assertive - Distancing
* Protective - Attachment
* Protective - Distancing

#### Examples

* Assertive - Attachment: "Hey, bro, I am trying to help you, but I won't do it at my own expense."
* Assertive - Distancing: "You should've known the rules of my class before you signed up."
* Protective - Attachment: "The problem was not with you, but with the team's management, I am on your side here."
* Protective - Distancing: "I don't have to explain the reasons for my decision to you."

### Aggressor's Counter-Tactics

The Aggressor's job is to balance the relationship. The Aggressor always goes to the **opposite** quadrant from the one the victim went to.

Defender: Assertive - Attachment
Aggressor: Sympathetic - Accuser

Defender: Assertive - Distancing
Aggressor: Sympathetic - Connector

Defender: Protective - Attachment
Aggressor: Scary - Accuser

Defender: Protective - Distancing
Aggressor: Scary - Connector

### The Real Defense Strategy

The real defense strategy is to avoid falling into the Manipulation Quadrants. The Defender should break the logic chain of the Aggressor and lead the conversation by asking questions.

The Defender should also try to avoid the Aggressor's questions. The Defender should not answer the Aggressor's questions directly, but instead ask questions in return. This will lead the conversation and help the Defender to avoid the Aggressor's traps.

#### Conflict Stages

There are 4 possible stages of conflict processing:

**Processing Emotions** - The Defender should understand the emotional state of the Aggressor and try to show empathy. This stage is needed if the conflict is not caused by conscious desire, but by unconscious emotions. The goal is to make the Aggressor feel understood and respected. Another goal is to help the Aggressor to understand their own emotions.

Examples:

* "Are you also feeling the pressure of the project deadline?"
* "I see, it could be annoying for you that we raised the price one more time."
* "Do you feel that I am not respecting your time?"
* "Mom, I understand that you are worried about my future. (At the same time, I want to make my own decisions)"

**Showing the boundaries** - If the Aggressor doesn't stop the conflict, the Defender should show the boundaries. The key concept is to show what boundaries were crossed and create a control influence on the Aggressor. Control influence could be either a question, a request, order or "right of refusal". (right of refusal is a phrase that shows the Aggressor a choice, e.g. "If you are not ready to do it, please let me know." or "I understand, that it could be difficult, so, I will understand if you refuse, but I need to know your decision.")

Note: Defender should avoid threats on this stage. The goal is to show the Aggressor your boundaries, not defend them.

**Defending the boundaries** - If the Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries, the Defender should defend them. The task is to break the script of the Aggressor.

Techniques to combat aggression (for any aggression, not only manipulation):

1. Show the consequences of the Aggressor's behavior. Examples:
   1. "If you continue to control my life, we will have to limit our communication."
   2. "Well, if you won't attend our meetings on time, we will communicate only by email."
2. Name the emotion they want to evoke and optionally call the desired behavior: "Do you want me to feel x (and do y)?". Examples:
   1. "Do you want me to feel guilty and work on weekends?"
   2. "Do you want me to feel like a bad mother and stay at home?"
   3. "Do you want me to feel like a bad friend and never ask for the money I lent you?"
3. Discuss the cause of Aggressor's behavior (only in private discussion). Examples:
   1. "Maybe you are trying to control my life because you are afraid of losing me?"
   2. "I feel like you do believe that I am a bad husband for your daughter. Can you tell me why?"
   3. "Why do you think I should be z?"

Only for manipulation:
In a huge number of manipulations there is a violation of logic. So, the another option is to show the fallacy of the Aggressor's logic.

Formulas:

"To be X do I need Y?"
"It hurts me to hear this because I feel like in order to be X I need Y"
"If I do X then Y"
"If I don't do X then Y"
"If it weren't for X, then you wouldn't have done Y"
"How is X related to Y?"
"Do you need X (in order for Y)?"
"What, will you do X?"
"Are you saying that I am X?"

Examples:

* "So, to be a good sun, I have to always do what you want, right?"
* "Do I understand it correct that if I spend a weekend with my family, I will be a bad friend?"
* "The only way you can become a Team Leader is to suck up to the boss, is it?"
* "You want to say that I am a bad mother because I am not ready to spend all my time with my kids, right?"

Some usefull phrases:

* Is this a request or an order?
* Is this a request or a threat?
* Have you asserted yourself? (if answers "no", go, to the second stage)

**Separation** - If the Aggressor continues to cross the boundaries, the Defender should separate from the Aggressor. The Defender should show the Aggressor that the Defender is ready to stop the communication and the relationship.

Note: There should be a warning before the separation.

Examples:

* "Well, I see that we can't reach an agreement. I think we should stop the project."
* "I understand that you are not ready to respect my time. I think we should stop the conversation."
* "Mom, I see that you are not ready to respect my decisions. We will limit our communication then. I am sorry, but I can't allow you to control my life."

**GENERAL NOTES**

* The Defender should avoid direct assessments/judgments of the Aggressor's behavior (e.g. "You are a bad father" or "When you did that mistake" or "You are trying to hurt me" or "You think I am a wrong, but ..."). Instead, the Defender should show only facts and his own feelings/impressions (e.g. "I feel that I am not respected" or "I feel that I am not heard" or "I feel that you think of me as a bad son"). That's a common mistake, which allows the Aggressor to continue the conflict, arguing about the Defender's assessments/judgments.
